    <h1>Peanut Butter Jelly Time</h1>
    
    <div id="instructions">It's time to make some sandwiches. But to make a peanut butter jelly sandwich, you're going to have squash a few grapes and peanuts.
        Move the peanuts onto the grapes to smash them with your baseball bat and turn them into a delicious snack. Once you've made all the sandwiches,
        you know what time it is. Let's ride!
